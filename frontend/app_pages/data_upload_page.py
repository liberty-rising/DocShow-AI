    ## Overview
    Welcome to the **Data Upload** page! Here, you can easily upload your data files into our system. This simple, user-friendly interface is designed to guide you through the process. 

    ### Steps:
    1. **Select File Type**: Choose the type of the file you're about to upload (e.g., CSV).
    2. **Choose Encoding**: For CSV files, select the appropriate file encoding.
    3. **Optional Description**: Add any extra description or comments about the file or data.
    4. **New Table**: Indicate whether the uploaded data should be stored in a new table.
    5. **Upload**: Finally, upload your file by clicking on 'Submit'.

    After uploading, you'll receive a confirmation message. If you encounter any issues, error messages will guide you on what went wrong.

    Happy uploading!
